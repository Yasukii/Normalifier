# Normalifier
A tera-proxy module that blocks specific abnormals in order to not trigger annoying screen effects on your client (e.g. Lein's Dark Root Beer).  
This is a fork of spaacecats' original no-drunk-screen and TeraProxys Version of Normalifier.  

## Usage
The module is enabled by default and will block annoying screen effects.  
  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* **norm** - enable/disable Normalifier
* **norm log** - enable/disable logging of abnormal IDs

## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.
